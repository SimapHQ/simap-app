*Simap: Storage Inventory Management and Planning*

Simap is a simple program for managing home inventory. My wife and I have a goal to store enough food and water, as well as other supplies, to support our family for a few months in the event that something happened. (Job loss, natural disaster, missed a shopping trip, etc.) Eventually we'd like to have enough to last a year.

We've struggled to find a low-friction method of tracking what we have, and what we need to meet our goal. This program meets our need.
